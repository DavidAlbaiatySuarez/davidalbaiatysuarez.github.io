								<h4> Amazon similarity algorithm in python </h4>
								<p>This algorithm is similar to the real-world similarity algorithm
								used by Amazon but more simplistic and with fewer number of users: my primary
								aim with this project was not to produce an efficient program but rather a functional
								piece of code to practice all the python concepts learnt throughout the year.
							    </p>
								<p>To put it simple, we have a finite number of books and each user has a score for each of
								books (0 if the book was not read) as a vector. If the user IS NOT in ratings.txt, we will ask the 
								new user to rate 5 different books giving us a new similarity algorithm.</p>
								<p>
								Using the dot product, we will then calculate the similarity of all users to one specific user and 
								give them x number of recommendations. The higher (non-negative) score, the similar the users are.
								We output the result to a .txt file.</p>

								<h4> Fully functional server & client in python </h4>
								<p> This is a fully functional server & client code in python. It was thoroughly tested to ensure that it 
								worked for a variety of file types as well as images. A test kit is provided as a separate folder. Server & client
								code in two different folders so that it can be tested locally.

								<h4> Interview questions from a wide variety of companies and increasing difficulty </h4>
								<p> The following files contains a variety of interview questions that were previously asked by big companies such as 
								Amazon and Twitter. They range in difficulty and each .py file contains a detail description of the task at hand as well
								as a fully commented solution(s)</p>

								<h4> Miscellaneous python mini-programs </h4>
								<p> This is a collection of python programs coded throughout the many years that I have been actively using
								python. All these programs were coded for practice purposes as well as to put new knowledge to test. (Some may
								seem like very basic now, but they were not 6+ years ago).</p>

								<h4> Memory save website monitoring </h4>
								<p>Given a start date, an end date, and one or more log files, the program is to 
								determine the percentage of access from each TLD during that period, outputting the 
								final percentages on standard output. This program is meant to be run in a Linux distribution (i.e.: Ubuntu)
							    </p>
								<p>For this project, we required more than just a functional solution; more precisely, we had to check for 
								memory leaks using the clang sanitizers (address, memory and leaks). Thus, the solution provided works as intended, is
								well-structured and commented and contains no memory leaks. Note, a 'make' file is provided.</p>

								<h4> Concurrent Dependency Discoverer in C++ </h4>
								<p> The aim of this project was to implement a safe, multithreaded dependency discoverer program
								in C++. We want a program that can crawl over source files, keeping track of any #include directives,
								go through files specified in #include directives, and finally generate the correct dependency specifications.
								</p>
								<p> Since we are using threads, we need to make sure that multiple threads cannot access common, critical variables at the 
								same time, to prevent deadlocks and the program from crashing/malfunctioning. This program is meant to be run in a Linux 
								distribution (i.e.: Ubuntu). Note, a 'make' file is provided.</p>

								<h4> Comparison sorting algorithms implementation & analysis </h4>
								<p> The following folder contains the implementation in Java of the following comparison sorting algorithms: insertion sort,
								merge sort, basic quicksort, quicksort with insertion sort, quicksort with median of 3 partition, 3-way quicksort. All the classes
								are fully commented and coded according to popular software engineering practices. Methods contain an appropriate description of their 
								time complexities.
							    </p>
								<p> Moreover a thorough analysis is provided in which we compare all the aforementioned implementations to a handful of files, taking 
								into consideration running times and drawing the necessary conclusions.</p>
								<p> I recommend viewing the project using Eclipse but I have also provided a link to all the individual .java files used in this project (use second
								download link).</p>

								<h4> Binary search tree & Doubly linked list implementation (with set-theoretical operations) </h4>
								<p> The following folder contains a Java implementation of a binary search tree and a doubly linked list with a wide set of additional
								set-theoretical operations. All the classes are fully commented and coded according to popular software engineering practices. Methods contain an 
								appropriate description of their time complexities.

								<h4> Useless control flow detector </h4>
								<p> The aim of this project was to detect useless control flow in IF, WHILE, DO...WHILE, FOR loops and SWITCH cases. For the IF statements,
								we also check if the ELSE statement is useless. Similarly, for the SWITCH control structure, we check every individual switch case AND the 
								default 'case' - these additional checkings are certainly an improvement on most control flow detector programs. All methods are well-commented and were 
								coded according to well-stablished software engineering practices.

								<h4> Compression ratio - Huffman & LZW encoding (Efficient) </h4>
								<p> The aim of this project was to calculate the compression ratio for the Huffman and the LZW encoding (straightforward) in the most efficient way
								possible (challenging) without producing an actual compressed file (we just want the compression ratio). This was challenging since I had to think 'outside the box'
								to deliver a very efficient program. All efficiency steps taken are fully explained as comments on each .java file.

								<h4> ReadingTime (website creation year 2 final project) </h4>
								<p> For our final second year project, we were tasked to create a functional website using Django and all technologies learned
								over the past two years (i.e.: Python, HTML, CSS, AJAX, XML ...). To make things more challenging, we only had 3 weeks to work
								on it, so clearly the website is quite simple albeit functional and well-designed. For instance, users can log in and participate 
								on the polls.
							    </p>
								<p> I have provided both the source code (first link) and also a link to the website to be accessed through PythonAnywhere. Note that
								servers are quite slow (since they are free), so it may take up to 20s to load the page.</p>
